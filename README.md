Lab: Thinking About Design
===

## Lab Instructions
Sketch your improved checkout flow. Begin with a rough brainstorming phase, then work towards more refined, wireframe-style sketches.

Provide details on

* User Interface elements
* Form behaviors
* Success and error reporting

Remember to sketch for both mobile and larger screens, and to provide sketches for **every step** in the checkout process. (I mean **every** step––we'll make a list in class. This is a large assignment.)

Remember to test your sketches with fellow students, using the methods we learned yesterday but with new partners. You should be seeking feedback from your TA and/or instructor.

* How long did you spend on this lab?

* What was the hardest and easiest part of the lab?
